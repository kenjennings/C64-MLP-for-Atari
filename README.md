# C64-MLP-for-Atari
Atari port of C64 Machine Language Project

[![AtariMLPScreen](https://github.com/kenjennings/C64-MLP-for-Atari/blob/master/AtariMLP.png)](#features)

Includes all files duplicated from original C64 MLP with edits specific to Atari.

Extra files not relevant to Atari are included -- e.g. C64 sprite files.

NOTE that there are TWO release versions here.  1.03a is an earlier version with more bugs.   1.03b is current and works better.
